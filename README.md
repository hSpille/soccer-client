soccer-client
=============

Actually, its a Client for the 2D-Simulation-Soccer-Server from RoboCup. The client ist mostly compatible with the Server-Version used in 
the ppa Repository for Ubuntu at https://launchpad.net/~gnurubuntu/+archive/rubuntu

Download the sources, import the project with maven to eclipse if deliberated.

Implement an agent like shown in the agent class, run the starter and watch your code going after the ball.

Cheers.
